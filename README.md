# UCLA Digital Humanities 140 

The goals of this course is to develop fluency and proficiency in the Python programming language through humanities based projects such as: identifying patterns in literature, recommending music to friends, mapping urban inequities, and analyzing social networks. We will learn to develop general coding skills and apply our abilities in the lens of Data Science research & practice. Utilizing Python as our main programming language, this course aims to critically describe, analyze, and visualize data within the humanities context.

## My Objectives For this Course: 
- Gain proficiency coding in Python 
- Design a Data Centric project that highlights my Statistical Analysis & Visualizations skills

## My Project Ideas: 
- Video Game Evolution: Analyze & visualize the common trends of popular video games over the years and highlight any interesting patterns in consumer behavior and video game metrics
 
# About Me

I am currently a senior Statistics undergraduate scholar from UCLA, interested in a career in Data Science to pursue my passions for discovering data-driven insights and informing businesses on strategic decision making. With an appreciation for music, fashion, and technology: my goal is to bring my talents to the entertainment & media technology industries where I can make an impact aiding businesses in critical & operational tasks through the power of statistics & machine learning. 

My expertise is in code development and data engineering: I retain a strong background in the interdisciplinary field of data visualization as a Digital Humanities scholar where I became savvy with Tableau and other graphic visualization technologies. As I finish up my final year in undergrad, in the coming future I hope to further expand & develop my skillset as I grow into a refined Data Scientist.
